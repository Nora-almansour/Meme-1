# Meme App Project
This app is a part of Udacity iOS NanoDegree that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.

Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
